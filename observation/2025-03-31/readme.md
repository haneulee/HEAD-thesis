## 3. Final Reflection

### **Recurring Patterns**

- **Wind and bird sounds** were consistent in the quieter areas, often paired with greenery and residential surroundings.
- I noticed that **People in motion** (walking, biking, commuting) were shown throughout the journey, but their **pace and purpose** changed > fast and busy near roads, slow and relaxed near parks and housing.

---

### **New Questions**

- How do urban transitions from noise to quiet, public to private affect our **mood or mental state** during walking?
- What kind of **invisible systems** are underlying these places?
  - (e.g., security infrastructure near embassies, transportation data at intersections, networks in residential areas)
- Could a walking route like this be mapped in **energy flow terms** instead of physical structure?
  - What’s the "emotional" topography?

---

### **Next Places or Themes to Explore**

- A **single area at multiple times of day** — e.g., observing the same park in the morning, afternoon, and late evening.
- A walk focused on **invisible infrastructures** (CCTV, antennas, sensors, power lines).
- Diffrerent places such as shopping center, train station, etc.
