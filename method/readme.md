# Living Networks: Seeking New Belongings in a Post-Family Korean Society

## 1. Research Question

- How can immersive 3D digital environments offer alternative forms of emotional belonging beyond traditional family structures, especially in the context of Korean society?
- In what ways can personal presence and data evolve into living, communal entities within digital ecosystems?
- How does the cultural perception of family, community, and isolation in South Korea shape the need for new digital social environments?

## 2. Motivation

South Korea is experiencing a rapid shift from traditional family-centered values to a society where single-person households, non-marriage, and individualism are on the rise. Yet, the emotional need for connection and belonging persists. In a society where cohabitation before marriage is still stigmatized and social frameworks struggle to accommodate alternative lifestyles, new forms of community are urgently needed.

This project explores how personal data—emotional fluctuations, routines, digital footprints—can be transformed into living, evolving organisms in a 3D digital environment. These organisms interact, grow, and connect with others to form emotionally resonant networks that act as alternative social structures or “digital families.”

The project combines speculative design and emotional data visualization with critical reflections on post-family society to explore how digital worlds might enable new forms of communal belonging.

## 4. Methodology

### A. Exploratory Interviews

- **Number**: 2-3 participants
- **Target Profile**:
  - Young adults living alone (preferably Korean), or experiencing digital community through games, social platforms, fandom, or VR
  - Mix of genders and digital literacy levels
- **Sample Questions**:
  1. In what situations have you felt emotionally connected in a digital environment?
  2. What does “belonging” mean to you in your current life stage?
  3. If your digital traces (emotions, routines, messages) could grow into a living entity, what would it look like?
  4. Do you feel traditional family structures still meet your emotional or social needs?

### B. Observation

- **Settings**:

  - VRChat, Meta Horizon Worlds, Discord community spaces, Korean platforms

- **Methodology**:  
  Drawing from Nicolas Nova’s _Exercices d’observation_, this study applies the method of **Typologies of Interactions**. Rather than simply logging what users do, this technique focuses on categorizing and analyzing the **types of social and emotional interactions** that unfold in digital spaces.

- **Focus**:

  - **Forms of interaction**: verbal (text, voice), nonverbal (avatars’ gestures, proximity, silence, emotes)
  - **Emotional expression**: how users express care, attention, intimacy, or withdrawal
  - **Group formation and dissolution**: spatial clustering, body orientation, follow/unfollow behaviors
  - **Language of belonging**: use of shared symbols, recurring rituals, expressions of “we-ness”
  - **Ambient behaviors**: users staying near others without talking, shared idleness or rhythms
  - **Temporal aspects**: timing, duration, and recurrence of emotional or affiliative interactions

- **Tools**:
  - Time-coded field notes
  - Sketches of spatial proximity and user flow
  - Screenshots (when ethically appropriate)
  - Reflection logs on emotional atmosphere and user presence

- Ongoing review of sociological, philosophical, and design theory literature related to digital sociology, family transformation, and emotional interface design.
