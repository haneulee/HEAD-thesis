# Living Networks: Seeking New Belongings in a Post-Family Korean Society

<!-- Alternate title: The Feeling Web: Digital Kinship and the Poetics of Online Belonging -->

## 1. Research Question

- How can immersive and poetic digital environments offer alternative forms of emotional belonging beyond traditional family structures, especially in the context of Korean society?
- In what ways can personal presence and data evolve into living, communal entities within digital ecosystems?
- How does the cultural perception of family, community, and isolation in South Korea shape the need for new digital social environments?

## 2. Motivation

Contemporary South Korean society is undergoing a major transformation in how people form relationships and communities. While traditional family-centered structures are dissolving—with rising numbers of single-person households, declining marriage rates, and increased individualism—emotional needs for connection and belonging remain constant.

However, the ways people relate to each other are shifting. In today’s networked society, social relationships often take the form of index relationships—strategic, surface-level connections based on visibility, efficiency, and functionality. These types of ties prioritize optimized communication over emotional depth. People recognize one another through likes, emojis, and digital presence, yet seldom share genuine intimacy or deep emotional resonance.

This project begins with a critical response to that condition. Instead of accepting that our online ties must remain shallow or transactional, it explores how digital environments might grow deeper roots—creating new emotional ecosystems for care, companionship, and alternative kinship.

Inspired by Laurel Schwulst’s poetic metaphor of the website as “a shifting house next to a river of knowledge,” this project imagines digital spaces not as fixed tools or dashboards, but as soft, evolving habitats. Here, personal data—emotional fluctuations, routines, digital footprints—becomes the soil from which living, emotionally responsive organisms emerge.

These organisms—shaped by personal experiences yet socially entangled—interact, grow, and form resonant networks that resemble emotional communities or “digital families.” The project proposes that in a society where institutional belonging is failing, we can design digital environments that feel not only functional, but alive.

## 4. Methodology

### A. Exploratory Interviews

- **Number**: 2-3 participants
- **Target Profile**:
  - Young adults living alone (preferably Korean), or experiencing digital community through games, social platforms, fandom, or VR
  - Mix of genders and digital literacy levels
- **Sample Questions**:
  1. In what situations have you felt emotionally connected in a digital environment?
  2. What does “belonging” mean to you in your current life stage?
  3. If your digital traces (emotions, routines, messages) could grow into a living entity, what would it look like?
  4. Do you feel traditional family structures still meet your emotional or social needs?

### B. Observation

- **Settings**:

  - VRChat, Meta Horizon Worlds, Discord community spaces, Korean platforms

- **Methodology**:  
  Drawing from Nicolas Nova’s _Exercices d’observation_, this study applies the method of **Typologies of Interactions**. Rather than simply logging what users do, this technique focuses on categorizing and analyzing the **types of social and emotional interactions** that unfold in digital spaces.

- **Focus**:

  - **Forms of interaction**: verbal (text, voice), nonverbal (avatars’ gestures, proximity, silence, emotes)
  - **Emotional expression**: how users express care, attention, intimacy, or withdrawal
  - **Group formation and dissolution**: spatial clustering, body orientation, follow/unfollow behaviors
  - **Language of belonging**: use of shared symbols, recurring rituals, expressions of “we-ness”
  - **Ambient behaviors**: users staying near others without talking, shared idleness or rhythms
  - **Temporal aspects**: timing, duration, and recurrence of emotional or affiliative interactions

- **Tools**:
  - Time-coded field notes
  - Sketches of spatial proximity and user flow
  - Screenshots (when ethically appropriate)
  - Reflection logs on emotional atmosphere and user presence

### C. Reading & Analysis

- Ongoing review of sociological, philosophical, and design theory literature related to digital sociology, family transformation, and emotional interface design.
