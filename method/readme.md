# Living Networks: Belonging Beyond Family in Korea

## 1. Research Question

<!-- - How can digital spaces offer emotional belonging beyond traditional families?
- How can personal data become a living, shared presence online?
- Why are new forms of digital community especially needed in Korean society? -->

- How can the digital community experiences of Korean youth be conceptualized as a new relational theory of the “living network”?
- In what ways do platform-specific modes of interaction (non-verbal signals, avatars, simultaneous experiences) generate emotional bonds of “families that are not families”?
- How does the tension between Korea’s collectivist culture and the process of individualization produce distinctive forms of community in digital spaces?

## 2. Motivation

Contemporary South Korean society is undergoing a major transformation in how people form relationships and communities. While traditional family-centered structures are dissolving—with rising numbers of single-person households, declining marriage rates, and increased individualism—emotional needs for connection and belonging remain constant.

However, the ways people relate to each other are shifting. In today’s networked society, social relationships often take the form of **index relationships**—strategic, surface-level connections based on visibility, efficiency, and functionality. These types of ties prioritize optimized communication over emotional depth. People recognize one another through likes, emojis, and digital presence, yet seldom share genuine intimacy or deep emotional resonance.

This project begins with a critical response to that condition. Instead of accepting that our online ties must remain shallow or transactional, it explores how digital environments might grow deeper roots—creating new emotional ecosystems for care, companionship, and alternative kinship.

Inspired by Laurel Schwulst’s poetic metaphor of the website as **“a shifting house next to a river of knowledge,”** this project imagines digital spaces not as fixed tools or dashboards, but as soft, evolving habitats. Here, personal data—emotional fluctuations, routines, digital footprints—becomes the soil from which living, emotionally responsive organisms emerge.

These organisms—shaped by personal experiences yet socially entangled—interact, grow, and form resonant networks that resemble emotional communities or “digital families.” The project proposes that in a society where institutional belonging is failing, we can design digital environments that feel not only functional, but alive.

## 4. Methodology

### A. Exploratory Interviews

- **Number**: 2-3 participants
- **Target Profile**:
  - Young adults living alone (preferably Korean), or experiencing digital community through games, social platforms, fandom, or VR
  - Mix of genders and digital literacy levels
- **Sample Questions**:
  1. In what situations have you felt emotionally connected in a digital environment?
  2. What does “belonging” mean to you in your current life stage?
  3. If your digital traces (emotions, routines, messages) could grow into a living entity, what would it look like?
  4. Do you feel traditional family structures still meet your emotional or social needs?

### B. Participatory Observation

- **Approach**: Drawing from Nicolas Nova’s _Exercices d’observation_, particularly **Exercice #11: Observation Participante**, this research emphasizes immersion in digital social spaces. Rather than observing from a distance, the researcher actively participates in virtual environments to gain insight into emotional dynamics.

- **Settings**:

  - VRChat, Meta Horizon Worlds, Discord servers, Korean digital platforms (fan cafés, open chat rooms)

- **Process**:

  1. Join digital spaces regularly and for extended periods.
  2. Contribute socially and emotionally (help newcomers, engage in conversation, participate in shared rituals).
  3. Observe verbal and nonverbal cues: silence, emotional language, gestures, avatar proximity.
  4. Apply **Exercice #4 (Arpentages)**: Note how users move spatially in digital environments.
  5. Apply **Exercice #5 (Relevés de conversation)**: Record and reflect on emotionally resonant exchanges.
  6. Apply **Exercice #6 (Gestes et postures)**: Observe avatar behaviors, posture, and ambient presence.
  7. After each session, write a detailed narrative describing emotional atmosphere, notable interactions, and your own affective state.

- **Tools**:

  - Time-stamped notes
  - Sketches and diagrams of spatial and social arrangements
  - Screenshots (when ethically appropriate)
  - A log of emotional reflections

### C. Reading & Analysis

- Digital sociology and emotional communities
- The transformation of family structures
- Technopoetics and speculative design
- Interface and interaction design

## Feedback

- Online ethnography
- compare with western online platforms like 'second life'
- Korean references (academic papers, books, etc.) in terms of sociology
- do observation in digital spaces before reading references
