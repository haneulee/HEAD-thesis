**Haneul:** Hello! Thank you for agreeing to this interview. Can you hear me well?  
**Loeva:** Yes, I can. Everything’s working fine now.

**Haneul:** Great. Let me share my screen to introduce my research topic.  
**Loeva:** Sure, go ahead.

**Haneul:** So my thesis is called **“Redesigning Families: How young Koreans rewire sociability through online platforms and interfaces.”**

It’s about how Korean youth are reconstructing intimacy and belonging outside the traditional family, through digital platforms.  
Korean society is very family-oriented, but many people now feel emotional distance from that structure — they turn to digital communities for a sense of belonging.

I’m studying three questions:

1. How do young Koreans mobilize digital platforms to create sociability absent in traditional family structures?
2. How do interface design and UX/UI shape those feelings of intimacy or connection?
3. How do users appropriate or “hack” platforms to form their own emotional spaces?

**Loeva:** That’s really interesting. I can already see some parallels with what I’ve studied in online roleplaying and virtual identities.

**Haneul:** During COVID, many Koreans used a platform called _Gather Town_ — a 3D meeting space with avatars.  
People worked remotely but still wanted to _feel together_. One user told me: _“It’s not just about working — it’s about feeling that you belong somewhere.”_

**Loeva:** Yes, I can totally relate. It’s about presence, not just function.

**Haneul:** Exactly. In Korea, there’s even a word, **Mogakko**, meaning _“gather together, work individually. (especially in IT fields, coding)”_ People share space but don’t necessarily interact.

**Loeva:** That’s fascinating — I’ve never heard of a similar concept in Europe. It says a lot about cultural values around togetherness and solitude.

**Haneul:** Right. I also observed something called _index relationships_, where young people categorize friends by context — for example, “Instagram friends,” “gaming friends,” or “art friends.”  
So, sociability becomes modular and intentional.

**Loeva:** I see. That fits with how online identity can be fragmented across platforms. People build parallel micro-networks that each serve specific emotional or creative needs.

---

**Haneul:** I did a small online survey with 13 Korean users.  
They said they express emotions through emojis, memes, and voice messages — rather than words.  
Many said they love their family but can’t always share everything with them. When that happens, they turn to online spaces to talk to people who “get” them.

**Loeva:** Yes, that sounds very familiar. In my own research, I’ve met people who come from conservative homes or environments where they can’t express certain aspects of themselves — especially around gender or sexuality.

For those people, online spaces become safe zones — places to be authentic without fear of judgment.  
Some even said that online friends became their “real” support system.

**Haneul:** That’s exactly what I’m seeing too.

---

**Haneul:** I chose _Zepeto_ (a 3D avatar-based social platform) and _KakaoTalk_ (a chat app with public open rooms) as my main case studies.  
_Zepeto_ users often create “virtual families,” complete with parents, siblings, and partners. They sometimes roleplay domestic life entirely online.

**Loeva:** Yes, that’s a perfect example of what we call _performative belonging._  
When people roleplay, they perform not only characters but also _emotional structures._  
In MMORPGs, for instance, players form guilds, couples, or families — sometimes as a way of experiencing social roles they can’t access offline.

**Haneul:** That’s so interesting. Could you tell me more about how roleplay works sociologically?

**Loeva:** Sure. There are different types.  
Some are purely fictional — players invent characters for stories or games.  
Others are experimental — like gender-swapping avatars to explore identity.

For example, in my fieldwork, I met male players who created female avatars. When I asked why, they said:

> “People are kinder to you when you’re a girl, and sometimes they even give you free stuff.”

So there’s utility, but also an emotional side: curiosity, empathy, or even power dynamics.

**Haneul:** That’s fascinating.

**Loeva:** Online identity allows for experimentation — you can change appearance, gender, or personality. If you can’t dye your hair red in real life, you can do it online.  
That’s freedom — _designing yourself_.

---

**Haneul:** Yes, and in _Zepeto_ or _KakaoTalk_, I see users using avatars and emojis to express identity — colors, gestures, even micro-emotions.

**Loeva:** Exactly. Avatars are symbolic. They let you visualize how you _want_ to be seen.  
In more open communities, like in Europe or North America, people can express sexuality, politics, or gender freely through avatars.

But I imagine in Korea, social norms might make that harder — so the digital space becomes even more important.

**Haneul:** Right. Many Korean users said they feel freer online than in real life.

---

**Haneul:** What about boundaries in online relationships? Do people maintain emotional distance even while roleplaying intimacy?

**Loeva:** That’s a great question. As anthropologists, we try not to generalize, but usually the “human side” takes over.  
Even if you start roleplaying, you end up forming real bonds. It’s almost inevitable.

Games and virtual worlds are designed to create interdependence — you can’t progress alone.  
So sociability becomes built into the mechanics: you need others to achieve things.

**Haneul:** That’s true. So intimacy is literally programmed into the design.  
**Loeva:** Exactly — the _architecture_ of the game forces collaboration and community.

---

**Haneul:** I also saw people on _Zepeto_ making short dramas or roleplay families. Some even create emotional storylines — they perform relationships.  
**Loeva:** That’s beautiful. It’s both performance and social repair — a way to build what’s missing offline.  
Through roleplay, users _rehearse intimacy_ and _design care structures_ that aren’t available in real life.

**Haneul:** Yes, it’s like emotional prototyping.

**Loeva:** That’s a good term. You could say online platforms become laboratories of social feeling — where identity, empathy, and connection are constantly being tested and redefined.

---

**Haneul:** That’s incredibly helpful, thank you. You’ve really given me a new lens to understand my fieldwork.  
**Loeva:** You’re welcome! Your research touches on something very current — the emotional infrastructures of digital life.  
**Haneul:** Thank you, Loeva. I’ll make sure to include your insights in my analysis.  
**Loeva:** I look forward to reading your thesis someday!

## Interview Insights

### 1. **‘감정의 수행(performance of intimacy)’**

> **Loeva:** “Online, intimacy isn’t just felt — it’s performed. Through emojis, gestures, avatars, we perform care and emotion.”
> _(온라인에서 친밀함은 단순히 ‘느껴지는 것’이 아니라 ‘수행되는 것’이다. 우리는 이모티콘, 제스처, 아바타를 통해 감정과 돌봄을 수행한다.)_

- **분석:**

  - 감정은 디지털 인터페이스를 통해 **시각적·행동적으로 연기(performed)** 됨.
  - 사용자는 플랫폼 안에서 감정을 **‘디자인’하고 ‘행동화’** 함으로써 관계를 형성.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “디지털 친밀성은 표현이 아니라 수행이다. 사용자는 감정을 시각화하고 연기함으로써 관계를 만든다.”

---

### 2. **‘대안 가족(alternative families)’과 감정의 프로토타이핑**

> **Haneul:** “In Zepeto, I saw users forming virtual families — parents, siblings, even kids.”
> **Loeva:** “That’s performative belonging. People build emotional structures they miss offline. It’s like emotional prototyping.”
> _(그건 수행적 소속감이에요. 사람들은 현실에서 결핍된 감정 구조를 온라인에서 만든다. 일종의 감정 프로토타이핑이죠.)_

- **분석:**

  - 가상 가족 형성은 단순한 놀이가 아니라 **현실의 감정 구조를 재현·실험하는 사회적 장치**.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “가상 가족은 감정적 결핍을 보완하는 ‘정서 실험실’로 기능한다.”

---

### 3. **정체성 실험과 젠더 전환**

> **Loeva:** “I talked with male players who use female avatars. They said people are nicer to you, sometimes they even give you gifts. It’s practical, but also a way to explore gender roles.”
> _(여성 아바타를 사용하는 남성 플레이어들과 이야기했어요. 그들은 사람들이 더 친절하게 대한다고 말했죠. 단순히 이득을 위해서가 아니라 성 역할을 탐구하는 방식이기도 해요.)_

- **분석:**

  - 디지털 정체성은 **젠더와 사회적 관계를 재실험하는 도구**.
  - 특히 억압적 규범이 강한 사회에서는 **디지털 공간이 안전한 자기 표현의 실험실** 역할을 함.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “디지털 공간은 억압된 정체성이 재구성되는 감정적 실험장이다.”

---

### 4. **LGBTQ+ 행진과 온라인 퀴어 연대 — _Tyria Pride 2020_**

> **Loeva:** “In some video games, players organize pride parades — virtual marches for LGBTQ+ rights. For example, there was _Tyria Pride 2020_ inside _Guild Wars 2_. Players walked together across the map for visibility and solidarity. It’s both activism and celebration.”
> _(몇몇 비디오게임에서는 플레이어들이 LGBTQ+ 프라이드 퍼레이드를 조직합니다. 예를 들면 『길드워 2』 안에서 열린 ‘Tyria Pride 2020’ 같은 행진이죠. 플레이어들이 연대와 가시성을 위해 지도를 함께 걸었어요. 행동주의이자 축제였어요.)_

- **분석:**

  - *Tyria Pride 2020*은 비디오게임 내에서 이뤄진 **디지털 프라이드 퍼레이드**로, 현실의 정치적 행동을 감정적 퍼포먼스로 변환한 사례.
  - 온라인 공간은 단순한 놀이의 장이 아닌 **정치적 감정(affective politics)** 의 무대가 됨.
  - 이러한 행진은 **공동 수행(performance of solidarity)** 이자 **감정적 행동주의(emotional activism)** 로 작동함.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “Loeva가 언급한 *Tyria Pride 2020*은 디지털 공간에서 정서적 연대가 정치적 행동으로 확장되는 사례다. 디지털 친밀성은 개인적 감정에서 집단적 정동으로 전환된다.”

---

### 5. **‘인간성의 회복’ 역설**

> **Loeva:** “Even behind avatars, people form real bonds. Humanity always finds its way back.”
> _(아바타 뒤에서도 사람들은 진짜 관계를 형성한다. 결국 인간성은 돌아온다.)_

- **분석:**

  - 온라인 관계는 인공적 매개를 통해 오히려 **인간적 감정의 복원(reclaiming humanity)** 을 실현.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “기술적 매개는 인간성을 대체하는 것이 아니라 되찾는 과정이다.”

---

### 6. **‘시각적 감정 언어(Visual Affective Language)’**

> **Loeva:** “Younger users don’t just write. They use images, colors, and gestures as emotional grammar.”
> _(젊은 세대는 단어를 쓰지 않아요. 이미지를 감정의 문법으로 사용하죠.)_

- **분석:**

  - 한국처럼 언어적 억제가 강한 사회에서 **이모티콘·색상·몸짓**은 감정 표현의 새로운 문법으로 작동.
  - 시각적 기호가 정서 교류의 핵심 언어로 부상함.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “한국의 디지털 친밀성은 시각적 감정 언어를 통해 수행된다.”
