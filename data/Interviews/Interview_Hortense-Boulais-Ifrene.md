**Participants:** Haneul Lee (Interviewer), Hortense Boulais-Ifrène (Interviewee)  
**Duration:** Approx. 50 minutes

**Haneul:** Hello! Nice to meet you. How are you today?  
**Hortense:** Hi, I’m fine, thank you. Sorry I’m a bit late — I was doing some sports and finished later than expected.  
**Haneul:** No worries. I should also exercise more, but I’m buried in thesis work right now.  
**Hortense:** That’s completely understandable. When I was writing my PhD, it was the same.

**Haneul:** Are you based in Geneva or Zurich?  
**Hortense:** Geneva. I saw that in your email signature too. Are you studying at HEAD?  
**Haneul:** Yes, I’m studying Media Design there. My thesis tutor is Anthony Massure.  
**Hortense:** Oh, I know him well! We worked together on a research project in Geneva last year. He’s great to collaborate with.

---

**Haneul:** That’s nice to hear. Let me share my screen so you can see my research topic. Do you see it?  
**Hortense:** Yes, it’s visible now.

**Haneul:** My thesis is called **“Redesigning Families: How young Korean people rewire sociability through online platforms.”**

My three research questions are:

1. How do young Koreans mobilize digital platforms to create new sociability—forms of belonging or intimacy—that are absent in traditional family structures?
2. How do UI/UX design choices of online platforms shape feelings of connection and emotional closeness?
3. How do users appropriate or repurpose these platforms beyond their intended design — in other words, how do they _hack_ or creatively subvert the platform?

**Hortense:** That’s fascinating, and I love that you’re combining sociology with design.

**Haneul:** Thank you! The idea started when I noticed Korean youth using _Gather Town_ — a 2D metaverse-like platform — to work together during the pandemic.

**Hortense:** Yes, I know it. The retro, pixel-art style reminds me of old Nintendo games.  
**Haneul:** Exactly. It allows users to create avatars and “be together” in the same digital room.

One of the users told me: _“It’s not only about having fun, it’s about feeling that I belong somewhere.”_  
That really struck me.

In Korea, there’s even a concept called **Mogakko (모각코)** — it means _“gather together, work individually. (especially in IT fields, coding)”_  
People share digital presence without necessarily talking.

**Hortense:** Interesting! That’s not something you see much in Western culture. It reflects a collective sense of comfort through co-presence.  
**Haneul:** Exactly. It reveals how connection doesn’t always require verbal communication.

---

**Haneul:** I also found that people form what I call _index relationships_ — they categorize friends by context: “Insta friends,” “school friends,” “game friends.” These connections are not necessarily deep, but they fulfill specific emotional or functional needs.

**Hortense:** Right. So each digital relationship has a function — belonging, identity, entertainment — even if it’s temporary or surface-level.

**Haneul:** Yes. And to explore this, I conducted an online survey with 13 Korean participants.  
I asked questions such as:

- How do you express emotions online?
- Do you feel your family meets your emotional needs?
- How do online communities fill that gap?

One participant said:

> “Being with family feels warm and stable, but sometimes I can’t share everything I want. In those moments, I find comfort talking to people online who understand me.”

So, online relationships often act as emotional supplements.

**Hortense:** That’s a very strong observation. Digital platforms can mediate intimacy where traditional structures fail.

---

**Haneul:** For my case studies, I’m focusing on **Zepeto** (avatar-based) and **KakaoTalk** (text-based).  
**Hortense:** A good contrast — one visual and immersive, the other textual and communicative.  
**Haneul:** Exactly. KakaoTalk also has _Open Chat Rooms_ where anyone can join anonymously. That’s where many users find emotional communities.

---

**Haneul:** Since your work focuses on virtual worlds, I wanted to ask: Why do virtual spaces become abandoned over time? Is it technological, social, or emotional?  
**Hortense:** It’s a mix of all three. Each platform has its own life cycle. Some fade due to technological obsolescence, others because of changes in social behavior.

For instance, _Second Life_ — launched in 2003 — is still alive today, but not with the same popularity. Around 2007, when everyone started using Facebook and smartphones, people moved to more accessible platforms. It wasn’t that _Second Life_ failed; it simply became too demanding compared to easier forms of social media.

So when communities leave, it’s not about technology dying — it’s about _social migration._ People follow their friends.

**Haneul:** So it’s like a digital diaspora?  
**Hortense:** Exactly. I documented communities from closing virtual worlds — yoga groups, Christian groups, artists — all scattering to new spaces, not always the same one. They tried to recreate their sense of belonging elsewhere. It’s a fascinating process.

---

**Haneul:** I’m also curious about the relationship between online and offline friendships. Some Korean youth hang out in both spaces — physical and virtual.  
**Hortense:** Yes, I think the boundaries are increasingly blurred. The virtual no longer opposes the real; it extends it.  
Still, small friend groups rarely sustain themselves long in pure metaverses unless there’s a shared activity — gaming, art-making, roleplay, etc.

**Haneul:** True. The activity gives purpose to sociality.  
**Hortense:** Exactly. Presence without purpose eventually fades.

---

**Haneul:** That’s an important insight for design — digital intimacy seems to need purpose and rhythm, not just space.  
**Hortense:** Well said. The health of digital communities depends on interaction patterns, not just tools.

**Haneul:** Thank you so much, Hortense. This conversation was extremely helpful.  
**Hortense:** You’re welcome, Haneul. Best of luck with your thesis — it’s a very meaningful project.

## Interview Insights

### 1. **‘감정의 수행(performance of intimacy)’**

> **Loeva:** “Online, intimacy isn’t just felt — it’s performed. Through emojis, gestures, avatars, we perform care and emotion.”
> _(온라인에서 친밀함은 단순히 ‘느껴지는 것’이 아니라 ‘수행되는 것’이다. 우리는 이모티콘, 제스처, 아바타를 통해 감정과 돌봄을 수행한다.)_

- **분석:**

  - 감정은 디지털 인터페이스를 통해 **시각적·행동적으로 연기(performed)** 됨.
  - 사용자는 플랫폼 안에서 감정을 **‘디자인’하고 ‘행동화’** 함으로써 관계를 형성.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “디지털 친밀성은 표현이 아니라 수행이다. 사용자는 감정을 시각화하고 연기함으로써 관계를 만든다.”

---

### 2. **‘대안 가족(alternative families)’과 감정의 프로토타이핑**

> **Haneul:** “In Zepeto, I saw users forming virtual families — parents, siblings, even kids.”
> **Loeva:** “That’s performative belonging. People build emotional structures they miss offline. It’s like emotional prototyping.”
> _(그건 수행적 소속감이에요. 사람들은 현실에서 결핍된 감정 구조를 온라인에서 만든다. 일종의 감정 프로토타이핑이죠.)_

- **분석:**

  - 가상 가족 형성은 단순한 놀이가 아니라 **현실의 감정 구조를 재현·실험하는 사회적 장치**.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “가상 가족은 감정적 결핍을 보완하는 ‘정서 실험실’로 기능한다.”

---

### 3. **정체성 실험과 젠더 전환**

> **Loeva:** “I talked with male players who use female avatars. They said people are nicer to you, sometimes they even give you gifts. It’s practical, but also a way to explore gender roles.”
> _(여성 아바타를 사용하는 남성 플레이어들과 이야기했어요. 그들은 사람들이 더 친절하게 대한다고 말했죠. 단순히 이득을 위해서가 아니라 성 역할을 탐구하는 방식이기도 해요.)_

- **분석:**

  - 디지털 정체성은 **젠더와 사회적 관계를 재실험하는 도구**.
  - 특히 억압적 규범이 강한 사회에서는 **디지털 공간이 안전한 자기 표현의 실험실** 역할을 함.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “디지털 공간은 억압된 정체성이 재구성되는 감정적 실험장이다.”

---

### 4. **LGBTQ+ 행진과 온라인 퀴어 연대**

> **Loeva:** “In some video games, players organize pride parades — virtual marches for LGBTQ+ rights. It’s a mix of activism and play, but it shows that online worlds can host political emotions too.”
> _(일부 비디오게임에서는 플레이어들이 LGBTQ+ 프라이드 퍼레이드를 조직해요. 그것은 놀이이자 행동주의이고, 온라인 세계도 정치적 감정을 담을 수 있음을 보여줍니다.)_

- **분석:**

  - 온라인 공간은 단순한 놀이의 장을 넘어 **정치적 감정(affective politics)** 의 플랫폼으로 기능.
  - 퀴어 퍼레이드는 **공동 수행(performance of solidarity)** 이자 **감정적 집단행동(emotional activism)**.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “디지털 친밀성은 개인적 감정에서 집단적 정동으로 확장된다.”

---

### 5. **‘인간성의 회복’ 역설**

> **Loeva:** “Even behind avatars, people form real bonds. Humanity always finds its way back.”
> _(아바타 뒤에서도 사람들은 진짜 관계를 형성한다. 결국 인간성은 돌아온다.)_

- **분석:**

  - 온라인 관계는 인공적 매개를 통해 오히려 **인간적 감정의 복원(reclaiming humanity)** 을 실현.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “기술적 매개는 인간성을 대체하는 것이 아니라 되찾는 과정이다.”

---

### 6. **‘시각적 감정 언어(Visual Affective Language)’**

> **Loeva:** “Younger users don’t just write. They use images, colors, and gestures as emotional grammar.”
> _(젊은 세대는 단어를 쓰지 않아요. 이미지를 감정의 문법으로 사용하죠.)_

- **분석:**

  - 한국처럼 언어적 억제가 강한 사회에서 **이모티콘·색상·몸짓**은 감정 표현의 새로운 문법으로 작동.
  - **논문 활용 포인트:**

    > “한국의 디지털 친밀성은 시각적 감정 언어를 통해 수행된다.”
