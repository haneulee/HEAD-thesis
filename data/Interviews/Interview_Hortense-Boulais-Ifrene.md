**Haneul:** Hello! Nice to meet you. How are you today?  
**Hortense:** Hi, I’m fine, thank you. Sorry I’m a bit late — I was doing some sports and finished later than expected.  
**Haneul:** No worries. I should also exercise more, but I’m buried in thesis work right now.  
**Hortense:** That’s completely understandable. When I was writing my PhD, it was the same.

**Haneul:** Are you based in Geneva or Zurich?  
**Hortense:** Geneva. I saw that in your email signature too. Are you studying at HEAD?  
**Haneul:** Yes, I’m studying Media Design there. My thesis tutor is Anthony Massure.  
**Hortense:** Oh, I know him well! We worked together on a research project in Geneva last year. He’s great to collaborate with.

---

**Haneul:** That’s nice to hear. Let me share my screen so you can see my research topic. Do you see it?  
**Hortense:** Yes, it’s visible now.

**Haneul:** My thesis is called **“Redesigning Families: How young Korean people rewire sociability through online platforms.”**

My three research questions are:

1. How do young Koreans mobilize digital platforms to create new sociability—forms of belonging or intimacy—that are absent in traditional family structures?
2. How do UI/UX design choices of online platforms shape feelings of connection and emotional closeness?
3. How do users appropriate or repurpose these platforms beyond their intended design — in other words, how do they _hack_ or creatively subvert the platform?

**Hortense:** That’s fascinating, and I love that you’re combining sociology with design.

**Haneul:** Thank you! The idea started when I noticed Korean youth using _Gather Town_ — a 2D metaverse-like platform — to work together during the pandemic.

**Hortense:** Yes, I know it. The retro, pixel-art style reminds me of old Nintendo games.  
**Haneul:** Exactly. It allows users to create avatars and “be together” in the same digital room.

One of the users told me: _“It’s not only about having fun, it’s about feeling that I belong somewhere.”_  
That really struck me.

In Korea, there’s even a concept called **Mogakko (모각코)** — it means _“gather together, work individually. (especially in IT fields, coding)”_  
People share digital presence without necessarily talking.

**Hortense:** Interesting! That’s not something you see much in Western culture. It reflects a collective sense of comfort through co-presence.  
**Haneul:** Exactly. It reveals how connection doesn’t always require verbal communication.

---

**Haneul:** I also found that people form what I call _index relationships_ — they categorize friends by context: “Insta friends,” “school friends,” “game friends.” These connections are not necessarily deep, but they fulfill specific emotional or functional needs.

**Hortense:** Right. So each digital relationship has a function — belonging, identity, entertainment — even if it’s temporary or surface-level.

**Haneul:** Yes. And to explore this, I conducted an online survey with 13 Korean participants.  
I asked questions such as:

- How do you express emotions online?
- Do you feel your family meets your emotional needs?
- How do online communities fill that gap?

One participant said:

> “Being with family feels warm and stable, but sometimes I can’t share everything I want. In those moments, I find comfort talking to people online who understand me.”

So, online relationships often act as emotional supplements.

**Hortense:** That’s a very strong observation. Digital platforms can mediate intimacy where traditional structures fail.

---

**Haneul:** For my case studies, I’m focusing on **Zepeto** (avatar-based) and **KakaoTalk** (text-based).  
**Hortense:** A good contrast — one visual and immersive, the other textual and communicative.  
**Haneul:** Exactly. KakaoTalk also has _Open Chat Rooms_ where anyone can join anonymously. That’s where many users find emotional communities.

---

**Haneul:** Since your work focuses on virtual worlds, I wanted to ask: Why do virtual spaces become abandoned over time? Is it technological, social, or emotional?  
**Hortense:** It’s a mix of all three. Each platform has its own life cycle. Some fade due to technological obsolescence, others because of changes in social behavior.

For instance, _Second Life_ — launched in 2003 — is still alive today, but not with the same popularity. Around 2007, when everyone started using Facebook and smartphones, people moved to more accessible platforms. It wasn’t that _Second Life_ failed; it simply became too demanding compared to easier forms of social media.

So when communities leave, it’s not about technology dying — it’s about _social migration._ People follow their friends.

**Haneul:** So it’s like a digital diaspora?  
**Hortense:** Exactly. I documented communities from closing virtual worlds — yoga groups, Christian groups, artists — all scattering to new spaces, not always the same one. They tried to recreate their sense of belonging elsewhere. It’s a fascinating process.

---

**Haneul:** I’m also curious about the relationship between online and offline friendships. Some Korean youth hang out in both spaces — physical and virtual.  
**Hortense:** Yes, I think the boundaries are increasingly blurred. The virtual no longer opposes the real; it extends it.  
Still, small friend groups rarely sustain themselves long in pure metaverses unless there’s a shared activity — gaming, art-making, roleplay, etc.

**Haneul:** True. The activity gives purpose to sociality.  
**Hortense:** Exactly. Presence without purpose eventually fades.

---

**Haneul:** That’s an important insight for design — digital intimacy seems to need purpose and rhythm, not just space.  
**Hortense:** Well said. The health of digital communities depends on interaction patterns, not just tools.

**Haneul:** Thank you so much, Hortense. This conversation was extremely helpful.  
**Hortense:** You’re welcome, Haneul. Best of luck with your thesis — it’s a very meaningful project.

## interview insights

### 1. **‘디지털 디아스포라(Digital Diaspora)’ 개념**

- Hortense는 가상세계가 사라질 때 사용자들이 흩어지지 않고 **다른 플랫폼으로 공동 이동하는 현상**을 관찰했다고 설명함.
- 이 현상은 단순한 “이용자 이탈”이 아니라 **정서적 공동체의 이주(emotional migration)** 로 이해될 수 있음.
- → 이는 한국 청년들이 특정 플랫폼(예: Zepeto, KakaoTalk 오픈채팅 등)을 떠나더라도 **관계망을 이동시키는 방식**과 유사함.
- **논문 적용 포인트:**

  > “디지털 플랫폼의 지속성은 기술적 요인보다 사회적 결속에 달려 있다. 온라인 가족성은 ‘공간’이 아니라 ‘함께 움직이는 관계’로 정의된다.”

---

### 2. **‘모각코(Mogaku)’의 사회문화적 함의**

- 한국의 ‘모각코(모여서 각자 코딩/공부)’ 문화는 Hortense에게 매우 낯설게 느껴졌음.
- 그녀는 이를 “비대화적 친밀성(non-verbal intimacy)”의 사례로 이해함.
- 즉, 대화나 교류 없이 **공간적 동시성(spatial co-presence)** 만으로도 정서적 안정감을 얻는 형태.
- **논문 적용 포인트:**

  > “한국적 친밀성은 상호작용보다 ‘공존’의 감각을 통해 형성된다. 이는 서구의 개인주의적 사회성 개념과 구분되는 디지털 친밀성 모델이다.”

---

### 3. **‘플랫폼 생명주기’의 사회적 차원**

- 플랫폼의 흥망성쇠는 기술이나 자본의 문제가 아니라 **사용자 네트워크의 이동성**에 따라 결정된다고 강조함.
- “사람들은 기술이 아니라 친구를 따른다.”
- → 사회적 리듬(social rhythm)이 디지털 생태계의 핵심.
- **논문 적용 포인트:**

  > “플랫폼의 수명은 기술적 혁신보다 ‘공동체의 지속 가능성’에 의해 좌우된다. 이는 온라인 가족성이 얼마나 강한 정서적 결속을 만들어내는지에 따라 달라진다.”

---

### 4. **‘목적이 있는 친밀성’**

- 디지털 관계는 단순한 유희가 아니라 **공유된 목적(shared purpose)** 에 의해 유지됨.
- 예: 게임, 협업, 공부 등 명시적 목적이 있을 때 친밀성이 지속됨.
- **논문 적용 포인트:**

  > “디지털 친밀성은 기능적 협업에서 비롯된 감정적 결속으로 발전한다. 온라인 공동체는 ‘의미 없는 교류’가 아닌 ‘목적 중심의 유대’로 형성된다.”
