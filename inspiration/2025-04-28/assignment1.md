| **Spatializing the Internet** | The internet is largely consumed through flat, 2 dimensional interfaces within browser windows. It seeks to move beyond the traditional browser, reimagining the internet as a navigable 3 dimensional space where information is experienced spatially rather than merely consumed.                   |
| **Nature change by Human**    | Driven by human activity such as urbanization, climate change, and pollution, countless species and natural landscapes are disappearing. It aims to capture and memorialize the process of environmental extinction, allowing users to experience the fragility and loss firsthand.                    |
| **New Forms of Family**       | As traditional family structures and communal living models decline, individuals increasingly live alone yet remain invisibly connected through digital networks. It explores how new forms of belonging and community can emerge in a post-family society.                                            |
| **Alive personal data**       | Most people today live alongside their personal data. It reimagines personal data such as steps taken, emotional fluctuations, or location history as organic, dynamic entities that grow, decay, and evolve, allowing users to experience their data as a living, emotional extension of their lives. |
