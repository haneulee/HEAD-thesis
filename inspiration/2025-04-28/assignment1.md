| **Spatializing the Internet** | The internet is largely consumed through flat, 2 dimensional interfaces within browser windows. It seeks to move beyond the traditional browser, reimagining the internet as a navigable 3 dimensional space where information is experienced spatially rather than merely consumed.                   |
| **Alive personal data**       | Most people today live alongside their personal data. It reimagines personal data such as steps taken, emotional fluctuations, or location history as organic, dynamic entities that grow, decay, and evolve, allowing users to experience their data as a living, emotional extension of their lives. |
| **New Forms of Family**       | As traditional family structures and communal living models decline, individuals increasingly live alone yet remain invisibly connected through digital networks. It explores how new forms of belonging and community can emerge in a post-family society.                                            |
