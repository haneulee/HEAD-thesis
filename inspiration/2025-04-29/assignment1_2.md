| **Living Networks: Reimagining Digital Space, Data, and Belonging** | It explores how the internet can be transformed from a flat, functional interface into a spatial, multisensory ecosystem. It investigates how personal data can evolve into living, organic forms within immersive virtual environments, and how digitally connected individuals physically isolated in post-family societies might form new emotional bonds and reimagine communal life. |

---

### Research Questions

1. What new spatial and sensory experiences emerge when the internet is reimagined as a 3D virtual environment rather than a flat 2D interface?
2. In what ways can personal data evolve into living, organic entities within immersive digital ecosystems?
3. How can digital environments enable new forms of family and belonging in a post-family society marked by physical isolation?

| **Relationship between visible and invisible** | Exploring how invisible energies such as sound waves, radio signals, emotional energies, and data flows interact with our visible world. By revealing and translating these invisible energies into sensory experiences, it investigates the hidden structures that underlie everyday environments and human perception. |

---

### Research Questions

1. How can invisible energies such as sound waves, radio signals, or emotional fields be translated into multisensory experiences through visual, auditory, or tactile interfaces?
2. What spatial or emotional impacts do invisible energies have on the physical environments we inhabit?
3. How can we perceptually access inaudible or hidden sounds in nature made by animals for communication or reproduction through artistic or technological interventions?
